/**
 * Linear equation system solvers
 *
 * Description:
 * A system is given in matrix form: 
 * ---
 * Ax = b
 * ---
 * For example:
 * ---
 * x + 3y - 2z = 5
 * 3x + 5y + 6z = 7
 * 2x + 4y + 3z = 8 
 * ---
 * For this system, A (coefficient matrix) will be
 * ---
 * [1, 3, -2]
 * [3, 5,  6]
 * [2, 4,  3]
 * ---
 * And b (right side vector) will be 
 * ---
 * [5, 7, 8]
 * ---
 * x is a vector of unknowns:
 * ---
 * [x, y, z]
 * ---
