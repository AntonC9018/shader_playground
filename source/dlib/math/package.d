/**
 * Linear algebra and numerical analysis
 *
 * Description:
 * dlib.math brings vector and matrix types to D, as well as some numerical 
 * analysis functionality. dlib.math is great as a math library for games, 
 * graphics/physics engines and rendering pipelines. All types are POD and 
 * OpenGL-friendly: you can pass your 4x4 matrices to OpenGL functions directly, 
 * without any conversion.
